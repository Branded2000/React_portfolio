# Personal Web Portfolio

This is a rebuild of my first portfolio. I migrated most of the work done in my 1st portfolio, which uses only HTML, javascript, and CSS, to React.

## What did I learn?

- Acquired the ability to bring to life the idea design I envisioned, implementing all the features and visual effects I had planned.
- Showcasing and communicating my projects to others and branding myself.
- Sharpened HTML and CSS skills to build the structure of a web page and give the user a good visual experience.
 
## New skills developed

- Working with React's state management to provide the best UX.
- Implemented responsive design principles to make sure my web page is readable on different screen resolutions.
- Improved my REACT skills and proficiency in creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
- Deploying a project allowed me to understand the deployment process of a react web app.
